# OrdersManagement
Design and implementation for an application for managing the client orders for a warehouse.

Consider an application, Orders Management, for processing client orders for a warehouse.
Relational databases should be used to store the products, the clients, and the orders. The
application should be designed according to the layered architecture pattern and should use
(minimally) the following classes:
• Model classes - represent the data models of the application
• Business Logic classes - contain the application logic
• Presentation classes – GUI related classes
• Data access classes - classes that contain the access to the database
